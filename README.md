# Charater Database Thing
A thing where you can store characters you've made. Characters as in people, as in OCs, as in fictional characters. The app doesn't assume anything about your character; it doesn't add a neat categorization, it doesn't have fill-in-the-blanks for age or personality or whatever. Instead, you can add as much information as you need and labeling them with whatever name you prefer. 

The interface is functional but garbage. I made this so I can practice using SQLite directly with Python 3, not to spend hours getting the interface right, dangit. The command-line interface is made with [Click](click.pocoo.org), which is also a dependency (sorry!). 

## What you can do now
- Creating new database straight from the program
- Create new characters
- Add more info to that characters
- Removing those infos
- See a list of all the characters you've made

## Features planned for and not yet implemented, and probably won't because I don't think I'll be getting back to this:
- Editing names of characters
- Categorizing each characters into worlds

## How to run
Make sure you have Python 3 with Click installed. Just download the repository. Run `python main.py` and there you go. It'll create a database in the same folder. 

##Time spent creating this 
(including reading documentations) 
4 hours. Clearly this is a huge waste of my time.
